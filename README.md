Just yet another guy who write code as you can find everywhere.<br>
This guy love strange ideas as if he is always drunk.<br>
But no, drunk coding is not good.

- Don't get me wrong: Webpack is powerful and I like the idea in general. However:
  - Its approach is too invasive: You cannot easily change your build tool, or decide not to use one, once you choose it.
  - Its configuration is not declarative as it promises.
  - Its assumption is way too much.
  - it is doing too much: it should have been the Makefile, not the compiler.
